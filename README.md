# kruskal-algorithm
Simple implementation of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. Findes spanning tree with the lowest combined cost of edges.

### Input
First line - number of vertices and edges
Rest of the file - begging vertex, ending vertex and edge weight

### Output
First line of output file - sum of weights.

Second line of output file - number of edges included in spanning tree

Rest of the file - edges included in spanning tree
